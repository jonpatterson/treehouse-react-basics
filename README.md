# Treehouse React Basics

The [Treehouse React Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-basics) course helps you to get up and running with React by creating a Scoreboard application.  The course was originally written for React 15, so I have shared my final Scoreboard application updated for React 16 and ES6.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and can be run using ```npm start``` from the project root directory.
